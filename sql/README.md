### **How?**
To answer the main question we needed to obtain data from kaggle.
We uploaded data to PostgreSQL and started working on it.

Firstly we needed to analyze data to find what is missing.
Then we started writing some simple queries to analyze most interesting variables in our opinion.

##  **Variables**
We have chosen 7 main variables:
* Home-ownership rate (*HSG445213*)
* Veterans factor (*based on VET605213 and PST045214*)
* White alone (*RHI125214*)
* Black or African American alone (*RHI225214*)
* Per capita money income in past 12 months (*INC910213*)
* Persons 65 years and over (*AGE775214*)
* Population per square mile (*POP060210*)
